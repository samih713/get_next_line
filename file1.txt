The Mexican–American War,[a] also known in the United States as the Mexican War and in Mexico as the Intervención
estadounidense en México (United States intervention in Mexico),[b] was an armed conflict between the United States
and Mexico from 1846 to 1848. It followed the 1845 American annexation of Texas, which Mexico still considered its
territory.
Mexico refused to recognize the Velasco treaty, because it was signed by President Antonio López de Santa Anna while
he was captured by the Texan Army during the 1836 Texas Revolution. The Republic of Texas was de facto an independent
country, but most of its Anglo-American citizens wanted to be annexed by the United States.[4]

Sectional politics over slavery in the United States were preventing annexation because Texas would have been admitted
as a slave state, upsetting the balance of power between Northern free states and Southern slave states.[5] In the 1844
United States presidential election, Democrat James K. Polk was elected on a platform of expanding U.S. territory to
Oregon, California (also a Mexican territory) and Texas; by any means, with the 1845 annexation of Texas furthering that
goal.[6] But the boundary between Texas and Mexico was disputed, with the Republic of Texas and the U.S. asserting it
to be the Rio Grande and Mexico claiming it to be the more-northern Nueces River. Polk sent a diplomatic mission to
Mexico in an attempt to buy the disputed territory, together with California and everything in between for US $25 million;
an offer the Mexican government refused.[7][8] The U.S. sent troops to the disputed Rio Grande, ignoring Mexican demands
to withdraw. Mexico subsequently attacked a group of 80 soldiers on April 25, 1846,[9][10][11] a move which Polk used to
convince the Congress of the United States to declare war.[10]
